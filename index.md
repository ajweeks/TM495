Devember Day 01

So today is December 1st, 2015. And I want to get back to coding more often, so I thought I'd take part in the #devember challenge. For those unaware and uninitiated, it is a challenge to write code for at least one hour a day for every day of December. You can see more at this website: [devember.org](http://devember.org/).

Another part of the challenge is to write a daily devlog to track your progress. I don't know if I'll be able to do it, I might end up running out of time one day, or forgetting on another. But I will try.

Today I spent a while working on a new concept I have for a 2D TypeScript game. (Right now it's called TM495, but who knows if it'll change). It's a lumberjack game, and that's all I'm saying for now. I won't be posting the code I write everyday along with these logs, as they are publically available on my GitHub page [github.com/ajweeks](http://github.com/ajweeks). I will state what project I worked on in each entry, and possibly even add a few code snippets once in a while just for the fun of it. You can find the TM495 repository at [github.com/ajweeks/tm496](http://github.com/ajweeks/tm495).

And, just to make it official, here's my pledge (off the website):

I, AJ Weeks, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be spent developing games. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise.

Here's to a productive Devember!

Lumberjack game
-Cut Down trees, points awarded for number of trees cut down within time limit
-Click as fast as you can? Or put a limit on it?
-Not a click-spam game like cookie clicker starts off as, maybe something more like Minecraft's method? (click & hold)
-Bigger trees take more hits, give more wood (points)
-Taller trees take same number of hits, give more wood

__GAMEPLAY__
_Option 01_
You have n seconds to gather as much wood as you can.
You must carry the wood back to your truck before time runs out for it to count (you can only carry x logs at a time)
In between games you can use credits earned during games to upgrade your character (see __Upgrades__ below)
Game field is a forest (pixel art by the incredibly talented yours truely)
Isometric view, camera follows player. Zoom level is about 1/4 of the full field
Forest is denser, and has bigger trees near the back of the field?
  -Trade off: walk farther and have to carry wood back farther, but get more

_Option 02_
Speed-running type game
Endless runner?
Like a race, where you have to chop wood along the way.
Each log removes time from your final time?
Trade off: only go for easy trees with lots of wood
   - Small trees are quick, basically instant - but return very little wood
   - Large trees are slow, requiring you to completely stop for a few seconds,
     but they drop much more wood

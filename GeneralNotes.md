# General notes

#### Game title
I'll admit that *TM495* isn't the catchiest name ever. It might end up being one of those secret code names that only the developers (probably only me, who am I kidding) will know. I have some other cool ideas, for now they're in an 'ideas.txt' file in the same repo as this project, at [github.com/ajweeks/TM495/issues](https://github.com/ajweeks/TM495/issues). But at least during development, this project will be called TM495.

#### THREE Namespace
I'm not going to import THREE, or use its namespace, or whatever it's called. Mostly because this is the first time I've used three.js and I want to be sure that I know what functionalities it has, and what functionalities I've implemented myself. That way when I start a project using pure WebGL, I'll have a better idea of what things I have to add myself.

#### Version Number
The version number at this point is pretty pathetic, I literally just increment it when I feel like a decent amount of code has changed, and I realize that's basically what you're supposed to do, but it does feel a bit arbitrary at this point. Maybe once the project gets off its feet the versioning will be (at least slightly) more meaningful.

#### Coding Style
As mentioned above, this is the first time I've used three.js, and on top of that, it's my first 3D project ever. So if you notice some blaringly obvious mistake I've made (or even a small one) that makes your entire body scrunch up into a ball, please either let me know on twitter [@liqwidice](https://twitter.com/liqwidice) or, even better - just file an issue on github at [github.com/ajweeks/TM495/issues](https://github.com/ajweeks/TM495/issues)

#### License
Since this project is very much a learning project for me, you can feel free to use any code for your personal or professional desires. I'd appreciate a mention somewhere though. I'll get around to adding a more official license once people actually show interest in it. For now it's just lil ol' me.

#### Author
What fellow human of yours wrote this? That'd be the one and only AJ Weeks. ([@liqwidice](https://twitter.com/liqwidice)) For now at least, I'm the only contributor to TM495. It's mostly a learning project for me anyway. I'm still not sure how realistic it is to develop a "real" game in WebGL is, the performance of most demos I've seen seem to be not very great. So a full game would likely be pretty unplayable once you loaded up a decent amount of content into it.
